## Workstation Configuration

This repository contains scripts and instructions for configuring a new Apple workstation. It is planned to merge into the `mgmt` repository.

To set up your Mac workstation:

1. Open the terminal on your Mac.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to maintain git repositories (for example, `mkdir github` then `cd github`).
3. Clone this repository by typing the command `git clone git@github.com:tagup/ops-loki.git`. You may be prompted to install developer tools; please do this to enable git via the command line. Note this is a public repository, so you will not be required to add your GitHub credentials.
5. After the repository has been cloned, run the following command: `sh softwareInstall`
6. Become a productivity ace!

If you receive any errors or have any issues at all, please raise an issue in this GitHub repository and Jon will address it. Sorry, Linux machines are not supported at this time (but will love any Linux guru to open a PR resolving this limitation!).
