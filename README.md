## Workstation Configuration

This repository contains scripts and instructions for configuring a new Apple workstation. It is planned to merge into the `mgmt` repository.

To set up your Mac workstation:

1. Open the terminal on your Mac.
2. Copy and run the following command: `sh softwareInstall`
3. Become a productivity ace!

If you receive any errors or have any issues at all, please raise an issue in this GitHub repository and Jon will address it. Sorry, Linux machines are not supported at this time (but will love any Linux guru to open a PR resolving this limitation!).
